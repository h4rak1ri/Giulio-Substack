Hi, Iâ€™m Giulio, a 22-year-old student in Data Science at Bicocca University of Milan. My passion for numbers and mathematics led me to study Machine Learning even outside academic walls. Indeed, most of what I write here serves as smart notes to remind myself of the fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence.

I created this blog for two reasons:
- As I aim to pursue a Ph.D. in Quantum Machine Learning, this newsletter can help me improve my ability to explain mathematical concepts to others.
- The posts I make are not just something I write to pass the time; they are genuinely the smart notes I use to remind myself how various things in this field work.

The blog publishes about one post per week. Some of these posts are a short lessons (<10 minutes) on concepts that can help you better understand how artificial intelligence works,     such as how convolutional networks function, what the Adam optimizer is, etc. The other kind posts are usually either a project I'm working on (an AI) or a paper review. In both        cases, anyone who wants to help me is welcome.
